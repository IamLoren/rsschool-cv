## About me
My goal is to start a career junior front-end developer.
I have a law degree and i am currently advocate. 
But i disillusioned in this profession in Ukraine and decided to drastically change my activity. 
Because the war has started in my country, i want to get an international profession.
In my life i always try to achieve the best result in any activiti that i do.
I graduated from school with honors and receive the master's degree in law with honors.
I  was the champion of Ukraine in powerlifting of the WPA federation in 2012 year.
I got the right to practice advocate in 2016 year.
I have experience of self-discipline, the ability to learn and achieve my goals.
Because i am sure, i will achive the high level of IT skills.
